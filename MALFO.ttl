We call `physical consequence' this kind of implication.
For example `peak vibration is 1.13 times over nominal limit' causes the `fatigue imposed on the axis to be 1.13 times than normal' (Matthews, A Practical Guide to Engineering Failure Investigation, 1998).

Note that physical-consequenc is a different type than other causal-consequences (e.g., achieves). For instance, a key difference is that causal-consequence requires a (possibly extended) spatial and temporal contiguity or overlapping, while physical-consequence is `immediate'/`synchronous' and does not take place somewhere nor during some time. Another difference is that causal-consequence is antisymmetric and not (generally speaking) transitive, while physical-consequence is transitive and could be bidirectional.""" .

The reason for introducing this term is to distinguish between the abnormal states of a component that require corrective actions from those that do not, since the effective cause of the fault is located elsewhere. For instance, if the right headlight of a car is not lit up when it should be, there are at least two possibilities: either the headlight itself is broken, say the lightbulb is blown, in that case `the headlight is not lit up' is a fault and the headlight must be repaired; or there is another component that is broken, say the wire linking the headlight to the car's battery is cut. In this latter case, it is the wire that must be replaced, and `the headlight is not lit up' is a down state.""" .

We consider that such classification is not necessary, and the z may belogn to other occurrent-types: for example, if `catastrophic fracture of the main axis' (z) causes the an industrial fan to `be completely non-operational' (x), the first occurrence (the fracture) is an event internal to the second occurrence (being non operational), a state, which is non function-compatible, and, therefore, a fault by definition.
 
Another example, this time in which the z is a state, is the `being cut into two parts'-state (z) of an electrical wire, which is an internal state that causes the state of `being unable to transmit electricity' (x), which is then a fault by definition""" .
